                As a student, I have found that chess is a fascinating and useful game to play.
                One of the reasons why chess is useful is that it helps to improve your critical thinking skills. 
                The game requires you to think ahead and anticipate your opponent's moves, which can help you to develop your 
                strategic planning and decision-making abilities. Chess also teaches you to focus and concentrate, as you need 
                to pay close attention to the board and your opponent's moves.

                One of the primary benefits of playing the piano is that it helps to improve your hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. 
                Piano playing requires you to use both hands simultaneously, and to develop precision and dexterity in your fingers. 
                Over time, as you practice and improve, you will notice a significant improvement in your ability to control your movements 
                and perform complex tasks with your hands.

                Being in a choir is also an excellent way to reduce stress and improve your mental health. 
                Singing has been shown to reduce levels of stress hormones and increase levels of endorphins, 
                which can help to improve your mood and overall sense of well-being. And because being in a choir
                 requires you to focus on the music and the group, it provides an excellent opportunity to escape
                  from the stresses of daily life and find a sense of peace and calm.
